        #CREATE THE ACTION GAME

        Since this is a more advanced project, it is recommended that you **duplicate** the entire `game03` folder from inside the reference folder and modify the existing files.

 

        Looking through a completed project and modifying it until it's your own is a great way to learn advanced topics.

        This project also contains two stylesheets - only modify the `styles-advanced.css` file if you are feeling very confident.

        #Let's Take A Closer Look

        Open up the `start.html` file and look inside the **body** tags:
        ```
          <header>
            <h1>The Learn To Code Day <strong>Carnival!</strong></h1>
          </header>

          <section>

            <input type="radio" id="target1"/><label for="target1"></label>
            <input type="radio" id="target2"/><label for="target2"></label>
            <input type="radio" id="target3"/><label for="target3"></label>
            <input type="radio" id="target4"/><label for="target4"></label>

        #INPUTS AND LABELS

        You typically cannot do click interactions with just HTML and CSS - this is usually handled with JavaScript or jQuery (a JavaScript library). One way developers get around this is to use existing HTML tags that are used in [online forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/My_first_HTML_form).

        The key thing to note for today's project is the `id` attribute on the `input` tag...

        ```
        <input type="radio" id="target1"/>
        ```

        ...corresponds to the `for` attribute on the `label` tag:

        ```
        <label for="target1"></label>
        ```

        It's very important that they match in order for this to work.

        Do you notice anything else about the `input` tag that makes it unique?

        It's<!-- .element: class="delayed" --> a **self-closing** HTML tag.

        #Labels

        In our project, the `label` is important, as it dictates the way our targets **look**.

        Let's take a look at the CSS for labels:
        ```
        label {
          background: #B109AA;
          border-radius: 50%;
          box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 15px #000000, inset 0 0 0 30px #ffffff;
        }
        ```

        * The default `background` of all our targets is purple
        * Our targets are circular - have a `border-radius` of 50%
        * We've used a new css property called `box-shadow` to trick CSS into giving us a double border on our targets. Change the pixel values and hex codes and see what happens!

        #Inputs: Radio Buttons

        The `input` element is used to create interactive controls for forms.

        There are [many different types of inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) that you can use. We are using an input with the `type` attribute of `radio`.

        A **radio button** is used in forms for making multiple choice selections where the user can only choose one answer.

        This is the opposite to **checkboxes** where you can choose multiple answers.

        #PSEUDO CLASS :checked

        Remember when you hover over an element, you can target that element in CSS using the pseudo class `:hover`?

        Well, you can do the same thing when you click a **radio button**, except it gains the pseudo-class of `:checked` in CSS.

        More on `:checked` in a few slides...

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #PSEUDO CLASS :nth-of-type()

        Another powerful pseudo-class is the `:nth-of-type()` selector.

        The `:nth-of-type()` selector targets elements based on their order in the HTML markup. Let's take a look inside our project's section tag:

        ```
        <input type="radio" id="target1"/><label for="target1"></label>
        <input type="radio" id="target2"/><label for="target2"></label>
        <input type="radio" id="target3"/><label for="target3"></label>
        <input type="radio" id="target4"/><label for="target4"></label>
        <input type="radio" id="target5"/><label for="target5"></label>
        ```

        The project starts off with 5 targets. By using the `:nth-of-type()` selectors in CSS we can now select each label individually:

        ```
        label:first-of-type {
          ...
        }

        label:nth-of-type(2) {
          ...
        }

        label:nth-of-type(3) {
          ...
        }

        label:nth-of-type(4) {
          ...
        }

        label:nth-of-type(5) {
          ...
        }
        ```

        #CSS Transforms

        The CSS `transform` property allows you to visually manipulate an element by skewing, rotating, translating, or scaling both in the plane and in the 3D space.

        We will be using the `rotateX` transform value to make it look like the targets have been hit and are falling backwards.

        <img src="framework/img/css-transforms.gif" alt="CSS Transforms">

        See the code for the above transforms [on codepen](http://codepen.io/team/css-tricks/pen/ebb6b5a5cec86aa04168f03e26c7501c?editors=1100)

        Can you find where the CSS Transform is being applied in the `styles.css` file?

        ```
        input:checked + label {
          transform: rotateX(70deg);
        }
        ```
        <p class="delayed">Whoa now - what does that `+` mean?</p>
        <p class="delayed">The above CSS rule reads as: "the label directly following the checked input tag" and then applies the CSS transform to that label.</p>

        <pre class="delayed"><code>&lt;input type="radio" id="target1"/&gt;
        &lt;label for="target1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt; &lt;!-- This one is selected --&gt;
        &lt;label for="target1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt; &lt;!-- Not this one! --&gt;

        <pre class="delayed"><code>&lt;input type="radio" id="target1"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another element&lt;/p&gt;

        #CSS Animations

        The last piece of the puzzle for our action game is getting the targets to move across the screen from right to left. This is achieved using CSS **keyframes**.

        Scroll all the way to the bottom of the `styles.css` file. That's where our keyframes live:

        ```
        /* CSS ANIMATION KEYFRAME TO MOVE TARGETS
        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - */
        @keyframes move {
          to {
              transform: translateX(-100%);
          }
        }
        ```

        In the above chunk of code, we are naming our keyframe `move`, and we want the life of the animation to move `to` a transformed value of `translateX(-100%)`.

        <p class="delayed">Clear as mud, right?</p>

        <p class="delayed">What this means: we eventually want the animation to move off the screen, to the left, at a negative value of 100%.</p>

        #CSS Animations

        Great - so we've established our animation keyframes and named it `move`. How do we apply it to elements in our CSS?

        Enter: the CSS `animation` property. Let's take a look in our `styles.css` file again, where we style the `section`...

        ```
        section {
          animation-name: move;
          animation-duration: 30s;
          animation-delay: 1s;
          animation-direction: forwards;
          animation-timing-function: linear;
        }
        ```

        There are a couple things going on here:
        <ul>
          <li class="delayed">We've assigned our keyframe `move` to the section using `animation-name`</li>
          <li class="delayed">We set the duration of our animation to 30 seconds (try changing this value)</li>
          <li class="delayed">We want the animation to start after the page has loaded and waited for 1 second</li>
          <li class="delayed">We want the direction of our animation to move forwards</li>
          <li class="delayed">And we want the overall speed of our animation to be the same throughout (linear)</li>

        #Customize The Game

        Now that we've learned a bit more about how the Action Game is built, try modifying it so it's your very own unique game!

        * How would you **change the speed** of the targets?
        * What if you wanted **square targets** instead of circles?
        * Change up the **colours** and **sizes** of the targets, **add photo backgrounds** of your friends!
        * Why stick to only 5 targets? **Add more** by copying the input/labels, changing the `id` and `for` attributes accordingly, and then modifying in CSS using the `nth-of-type` pseudo class!
